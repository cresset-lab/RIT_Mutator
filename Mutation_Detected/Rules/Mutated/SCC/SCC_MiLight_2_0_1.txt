1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2a1)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("3 - Milight_ID1_G1_CT")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("1 - Milight_ID1_G1_ONOFF")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_ctemp received command 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_state received command

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c1]: if (milight_id1_g1_state == on)

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: milight_id1_g1_light.sendCommand('{"state":"ON","color_temp":' + ictemp + '}')
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: milight_id1_g1_light.sendCommand('{"state":"' + receivedcommand + '"}')

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. SCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2c1)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("3 - Milight_ID1_G1_CT")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("1 - Milight_ID1_G1_ONOFF")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_ctemp received command 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_state received command

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c1]: if (milight_id1_g1_state == off) 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: milight_id1_g1_state.postUpdate(on) 

        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c1]: if (milight_id1_g1_state == on) 

    RESULTING ACTION:
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: milight_id1_g1_light.sendCommand('{"state":"' + receivedcommand + '"}') 


    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    WILL CAUSE A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.
