1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2a2)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("4 - Irrigation - update timer")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * * 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c1]: if (irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number > 0) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c3]: if (irrigationsectionremainingtime == (irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number) - 1)

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate((irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number) - 1)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a2]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate(valveopentime.intvalue)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. SCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2c3)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("4 - Irrigation - update timer")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * * 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c1]: if (irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number > 0) 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate((irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number) - 1) 

        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c3]: if (irrigationsectionremainingtime == (irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number) - 1) 

    RESULTING ACTION:
        ACTION_B:       [r2a2]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate(valveopentime.intvalue) 


    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    WILL CAUSE A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.
