1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a13, r2a3)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("1 Irrigation - system start")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: System started 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c4]: if (nextvalve !== null)

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a13]: irrigationcurrentvalve.postUpdate(off)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a3]: irrigationcurrentvalve.sendCommand(nextvalve.name)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. SCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a11, r2c3)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("1 Irrigation - system start")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: System started 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c11]: if (irrigationstarttime == null) 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a11]: irrigationstarttime.sendCommand(20) 

        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c3]: if (irrigationstarttime == 20) 

    RESULTING ACTION:
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: currvalve.sendCommand(on) 


    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    WILL CAUSE A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.
