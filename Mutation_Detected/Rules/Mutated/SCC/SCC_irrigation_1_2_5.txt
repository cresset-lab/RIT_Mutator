1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a3, r2a3)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("2 - Irrigation - calculate whether to start watering")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * * 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c4]: if (nextvalve !== null)

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a3]: irrigationcurrentvalve.sendCommand(irrigationvalvezone1.name)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a3]: irrigationcurrentvalve.sendCommand(nextvalve.name)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

------------------------------------------------

2. STC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a3, r2t1)

    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("2 - Irrigation - calculate whether to start watering")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR (ACTION_A --> TRIGGER_B):
        ACTION_A:       [r1a3]: irrigationcurrentvalve.sendCommand(irrigationvalvezone1.name)
        TRIGGER_B:      [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command
        
    RESULTANT TRIGGER CASCADE (TRIGGER_A --> ACTION_B):
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * *
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: currvalve.sendCommand(on)
    

    THREAT DESCRIPTION:
    WHEN INITIAL TRIGGER IS ACTIVATED
    THE TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR CAUSES 
    A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.

------------------------------------------------

3. SCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2c3)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("2 - Irrigation - calculate whether to start watering")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("3 - Irrigation - cascading")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * * 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationcurrentvalve received command

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: sumrainnext24h.sendCommand(groupforecastedrain24sum.state as number) 

        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c3]: if (sumrainnext24h == groupforecastedrain24sum.state as number) 

    RESULTING ACTION:
        ACTION_B:       [r2a2]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate(valveopentime.intvalue) 


    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    WILL CAUSE A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.
