1. SAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2a2)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("3 - Milight_ID1_G1_CT")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("2 - Milight_ID1_G1_BRIGHT")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_ctemp received command 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_brightness received command
    
    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: milight_id1_g1_light.sendCommand('{"state":"ON","color_temp":' + ictemp + '}')
        ACTION_B:       [r2a2]: milight_id1_g1_light.sendCommand('{"state":"ON","level":' + ilevel + '}')
    
    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. WCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2c2)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("3 - Milight_ID1_G1_CT")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("2 - Milight_ID1_G1_BRIGHT")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_ctemp received command 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item milight_id1_g1_brightness received command

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c1]: if (milight_id1_g1_state == off) 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: milight_id1_g1_state.postUpdate(on) 

        CONDITION_B:     [r2c2]: if (milight_id1_g1_state == on)

    
    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
