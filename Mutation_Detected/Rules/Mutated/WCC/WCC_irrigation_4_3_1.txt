1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2a1)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("5 - Irrigation - all valves closed")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("4 - Irrigation - update timer")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed to off 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * *

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [r2c1]: if (irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number > 0)
                    AND [r2c2]: if (irrigationcurrentvalve == off)

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate(0)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: irrigationsectionremainingtime.postUpdate((irrigationsectionremainingtime.state as number) - 1)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. WCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2c2)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("5 - Irrigation - all valves closed")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("4 - Irrigation - update timer")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed to off 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * *

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: irrigationcurrentvalve.postUpdate(off) 

        CONDITION_B:     [r2c2]: if (irrigationcurrentvalve == off)

    
    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
