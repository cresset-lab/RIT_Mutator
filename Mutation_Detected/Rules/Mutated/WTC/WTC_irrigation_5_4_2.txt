1. WTC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2t1)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("5 - Irrigation - all valves closed")

    TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR (ACTION_A --> TRIGGER_B):
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on)
        TRIGGER_B:      [r2t1]: Item irrigationtimermax changed

    OVERLAPPING GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c1]: if (groupirrigationvalves == on)
                    AND [r1c3]: if (irrigationtimermax == off) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action

    RESULTANT TRIGGER CASCADE (TRIGGER_A --> ACTION_B):
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: irrigationcurrentvalve.postUpdate(off)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION:
    WHEN INITIAL TRIGGER IS ACTIVATED
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ENABLED
    THE TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR CAUSES A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.

        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("5 - Irrigation - all valves closed")

    TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR (ACTION_A --> TRIGGER_B):
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: irrigationtimermax.postUpdate(off)
        TRIGGER_B:      [r2t1]: Item irrigationtimermax changed

    OVERLAPPING GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c2]: if (groupirrigationvalves != on) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action

    RESULTANT TRIGGER CASCADE (TRIGGER_A --> ACTION_B):
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: irrigationcurrentvalve.postUpdate(off)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION:
