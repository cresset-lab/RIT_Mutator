        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: sumrainlast24h.sendCommand((weatherandforecastcurrentrain.sumsince(now.minushours(24), "influxdb") as number).doublevalue)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.
