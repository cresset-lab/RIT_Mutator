1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2a1)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("7 - Irrigation - protection timer off, close all valves")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationtimermax changed to off

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c2]: if (groupirrigationvalves != on) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: irrigationtimermax.postUpdate(off)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

------------------------------------------------

2. WTC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2t1)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")
        RULE_B:         [r2]: ("7 - Irrigation - protection timer off, close all valves")

    TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR (ACTION_A --> TRIGGER_B):
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: irrigationtimermax.postUpdate(off)
        TRIGGER_B:      [r2t1]: Item irrigationtimermax changed to off

    OVERLAPPING GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c2]: if (groupirrigationvalves != on) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action

    RESULTANT TRIGGER CASCADE (TRIGGER_A --> ACTION_B):
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION:
    WHEN INITIAL TRIGGER IS ACTIVATED
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ENABLED
    THE TRIGGER-ACTION PAIR CAUSES A CHAIN OF ACTION EXECUTIONS.

------------------------------------------------

3. WCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r2a1, r1c4)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r2]: ("7 - Irrigation - protection timer off, close all valves")
        RULE_B:         [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r2t1]: Item irrigationtimermax changed to off 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r2a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on) 

        CONDITION_B:     [r1c4]: if (irrigationtimermax != off)

    
    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
