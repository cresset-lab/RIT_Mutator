1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a2, r2a1)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("2 - Irrigation - calculate whether to start watering")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * *

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c2]: if (groupirrigationvalves != on) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a2]: irrigationtimermax.postUpdate(off)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. WCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r2a1, r1c4)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r2]: ("2 - Irrigation - calculate whether to start watering")
        RULE_B:         [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r2t1]: Time cron 0 * * ? * * 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r2a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on) 

        CONDITION_B:     [r1c4]: if (irrigationtimermax != off)

    
    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
