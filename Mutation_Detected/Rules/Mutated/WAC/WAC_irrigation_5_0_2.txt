1. WAC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r1a1, r2a13)
    
    RULES:
        RULE_A [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")
        RULE_B [r2]: ("1 Irrigation - system start")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r2t1]: System started

    OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [r1c1]: if (groupirrigationvalves == on)
                    AND [r1c3]: if (irrigationtimermax == off) 
        
        CONDITIONS_B:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action

    CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS:
        ACTION_A:       [r1a1]: irrigationtimermax.sendCommand(on)
        ACTION_B:       [r2a13]: irrigationtimermax.postUpdate(off)

    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    CONTRADICTORY ACTION EXECUTION COULD OCCUR IN ANY ORDER
    WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE DEVICE STATE.

2. WCC THREAT DETECTED
    THREAT PAIR: (r2a13, r1c3)

    RULES:
        RULE_A:         [r2]: ("1 Irrigation - system start")
        RULE_B:         [r1]: ("6 - Irrigation - valve updated, turn on the timer")

    OVERLAPPING TRIGGERS:
        TRIGGERS_A:     [r2t1]: System started 
        
        TRIGGERS_B:     [r1t1]: Item groupirrigationvalves changed

    GUARDING CONDITIONS:
        CONDITIONS_A:   [c0]:   no conditions guarding action 

    CONDITION-ACTION PAIR:
        ACTION_A:       [r2a13]: irrigationtimermax.postUpdate(off) 

        CONDITION_B:     [r1c3]: if (irrigationtimermax == off)

    
    THREAT DESCRIPTION: 
    IF OVERLAPPING SETS OF TRIGGERS ARE CONCURRENTLY ACTIVATED
    WHILE GUARDING CONDITIONS ARE ENABLED
    THE CONDITION-ACTION PAIR
    MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
